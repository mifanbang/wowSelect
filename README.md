#### Introduction

This program is designed for WoW client prior to version 4.0, namely the *Cataclysm* expansion pack.

You can use an American English version of WoW client to play on Taiwanese servers. However it is required to modify some configuration file everytime you play. Therefore modification to the file is considered tedious.

wowSelect simplifies the work for you. It creates a temporary file with your desired server configuration inside, and then launches WoW client to load that file. By doing so, wowSelect doesn't alter any existing file in your system including any installed WoW client.


#### Instructions for Use

* If you are connecting to official servers in different regions:
  1. Run wowSelect.
  2. Select your desired one in the server list, and then click "Run" button.

* On the other hand, to connect to a fan server:
  1. Run wowSelect.
  2. Click "Configure" to edit private server list. The list is stored in the registry if you are interested.
  3. After adding some new entries to the private server list, you can now find them in the server list in the main window.

* By clicking "Shortcut", you can create a shortcut to the selected server in the list on the desktop. It can then be used to quickly connect to the desired server without interaction with wowSelect GUI.
